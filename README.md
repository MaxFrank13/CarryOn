## About CarryOn
CarryOn is a travel information website that allows a user to search a specified city's lodges, travel accommodations, and places of interest. Users are able to filter out certain categories such as; food, lodging, amusements, historical/cultural places of interest, nature, and sports. The user is able to specify a city using state and country codes as well. When the user searches a city, pictures highlighting the user's city will be displayed in a banner with the requested data underneath within cards.
